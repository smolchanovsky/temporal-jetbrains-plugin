# Privacy Policy

The Temporal JetBrains Plugin can collect anonymous usage statistics to help improve the plugin. **Analytics is disabled by default** and no data is sent until you explicitly give consent.

## Data We Collect

We collect **only anonymous, non-sensitive usage data**:

- **Feature usage**: Which buttons are clicked and which screens are opened (no content or user input is ever included)
- **Errors**: Error category name only (e.g., "connection refused"), without stack traces, messages, or any user data
- **Environment info**: IDE type and version, OS name, plugin version, Temporal CLI version
- **Anonymous installation ID**: A randomly generated UUID to count unique users (not linked to any personal data)

## Data We Do NOT Collect

We **never** collect:

- Workflow data — IDs, names, types, input, output, or history
- Namespace names or server addresses
- Values entered in any dialogs or fields
- Stack traces, error messages, or logs
- Any personal information or data that could identify you or your organization

## Consent and Opt-Out

Analytics is **opt-in only**. On first launch, the plugin asks for your consent. No data is sent if you decline.

You can change your choice at any time in **Settings > Tools > Temporal**.

## Data Storage

Analytics data is sent to Mixpanel and processed according to [Mixpanel's Privacy Policy](https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update this document in the repository.
